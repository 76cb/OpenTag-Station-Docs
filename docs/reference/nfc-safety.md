# NFC safety model

This technical reference describes implementation contracts. Dated test figures
below are historical checkpoints, not the current candidate’s acceptance record.
See the release checklist for outstanding physical checks.


The normal firmware supports automatic read-only recognition and explicitly
confirmed OpenPrintTag initialize/rewrite/mutable updates. The complete boundary,
mapping, Community contract and recovery policy are in
[production writer](https://github.com/76cb/OpenTag-Station/blob/58c458ba078c109fea88cd12f7a797bdb3f1f3a5/docs/openprinttag-writer.md).

The sole NFC/RFAL owner is the shared 16,384-byte opentag-backend task. Scale
remains on Wire (GPIO10/11); NFC uses the validated ELECHOUSE Wire1 binding
(GPIO13/14, IRQ12, 0x50, 100 kHz). Touch stays on LovyanGFX software I2C.
No task, transport, RFAL fork, or stack increase was introduced.

Periodic polling remains read-only: three stable inventory rounds trigger two
complete compared reads, with generation-fenced workflow handoff and fresh stable
weighing. No NFC activity runs in httpd, UI callbacks, or backend HTTP frames.
The explicit writer is dispatched separately at the backend run-loop boundary.

Only the approved NXP 80×4-byte layout is writable. Blocks 0–77 form the 312-byte
OpenPrintTag image; 78–79 are always preserved. Unknown application data is
refused. The standalone development image is retired and not shipped. Source plus object/ELF guards
restrict the destructive primitive to the private production binding and guarded
writer. No arbitrary raw writer or lock/protection API is exposed.

The old decoder baseline remains pinned to e0dab1a with additive read compatibility
for specification 7e09cc3's integer-micrometre diameter key 61. The new writer emits
that current key. Existing legacy-key reads and initializer golden fixtures remain
tested. A populated writer image is also validated by the independent pinned
upstream Python decoder.

Recognition, removal/reinsertion, and stationary read soak previously passed;
PR #27 physically restored settled internal heap to about 89–94 KiB, minimum
73.5 KiB, with zero NFC bus errors and functioning backends/browser/scale.
Those are the baseline. Writing requires the single consolidated
[physical acceptance procedure](https://github.com/76cb/OpenTag-Station/blob/58c458ba078c109fea88cd12f7a797bdb3f1f3a5/docs/release-validation.md).
