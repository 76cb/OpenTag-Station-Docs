# Upstream compatibility

This technical reference describes implementation contracts. Dated test figures
below are historical checkpoints, not the current candidate’s acceptance record.
See the release checklist for outstanding physical checks.


Research baseline established **2026-08-17**, OpenPrintTag rechecked
**2026-08-20**, and the ELECHOUSE diagnostic RFAL baseline pinned
**2026-09-12**. Source/API inspection and host-fixture success are not physical
RF-interoperability claims.

## Application integrations

| Upstream | Revision/version | Status | Dependency boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenPrintTag | [`e0dab1a`](https://github.com/prusa3d/OpenPrintTag/commit/e0dab1ae16838d2c342e7cfc509455441b7d8eba), 2026-07-02 | Rechecked 2026-08-20; implemented and host-tested against official fixtures; one-time physical initialization and checksum readback PASS, read-only browser preview soak pending | MIME record, regions, field maps, transaction rules |
| Spoolman | v0.26.1 / current `master` [`8d9eb73`](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman/commit/8d9eb7395da9553bdbf14b21231afe4e153f0a79), 2026-08-20 | Source contract revalidated and host fixtures pass; no live instance tested | `integrations/spoolman` only |
| FilaBridge | latest tag v1.2.2; main [`f35cde8`](https://github.com/sargonas/filabridge/commit/f35cde87505e7a617307527b8e8431dd2dc65f62), 2026-08-11 | Correct maintained repository revalidated; adapter and host contract fixtures pass; no live instance tested | `integrations/filabridge` only |
| SpoolmanScale | [`ea0515a`](https://github.com/Niko11111/SpoolmanScale/commit/ea0515ad92ec2fcb65af8c5f0e2bc1a4d01d305b), 2026-08-16 | Hardware facts inspected only | No code/architecture dependency |

OpenPrintTag intentionally avoids an explicit format version. Compatibility is
therefore recorded by Git revision, MIME type, and fixture corpus revision.
The opt-in blank-tag initializer is independently pinned to
[`openprinttag-specification` `7e09cc3`](https://github.com/OpenPrintTag/openprinttag-specification/commit/7e09cc38df1c8e7824a67f5b1ae93071f52519ad).
CI generates the canonical 312-byte image with that revision's Python
initializer using `--aux-region=32` and compares it byte-for-byte with the
embedded C++ golden vector. The initializer therefore reserves the mutable
auxiliary area used by fields such as consumed weight and workgroup.
This diagnostic-only pin does not change the production decoder baseline.

## NFC/RFAL

| Component | Baseline | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ST25R3916B | [DS13541 Rev 11](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/st25r3916b.pdf) | Dedicated `Wire1` transport, direct identity, IRQ, NFC-V inventory, stable UID, system information, geometry, and repeated full-memory reads physically PASS on GPIO13/14/12 |
| ELECHOUSE RFAL for ESP32 | [`wilson-elechouse/ST25R3916` `16eb6c7`](https://github.com/wilson-elechouse/ST25R3916/commit/16eb6c7fb13e502d320924040d768a9e564209b2) | `ST25R3916_ELECHOUSE` 1.1.1 and `NFC-RFAL` 1.0.2 vendored unchanged for the opt-in diagnostic; object API runs over injected `Wire1`; physical NFC-V inventory, read-only memory, and one-time guarded blank initialization PASS; write control retired |
| ST RFAL | [STSW-ST25RFAL002](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stsw-st25rfal002.html) and [UM2890 Rev 7](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um2890-rfnfc-abstraction-layer-rfal-stmicroelectronics.pdf) | Remains the production architecture reference; no production NFC binding is enabled |
| X-CUBE-NFC6 | [ST product package](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-nfc6.html) | Port/reference source only, not a build dependency |

The diagnostic pin is reproducible and isolated under
`third_party/ELECHOUSE_ST25R3916`; its provenance and licenses are recorded in
that directory. It does not silently replace the still-gated production RFAL
binding. The production enable flag remains false until the RF diagnostic and a
separate production-integration review pass.

## Build dependencies

| Component | Pin |
|---|---|
| PlatformIO Core | 6.1.19 |
| PlatformIO Espressif 32 | 6.13.0 |
| Arduino-ESP32 framework | 2.0.17 (provided by platform 6.13.0) |
| LVGL | 8.3.11 |
| LovyanGFX | 1.2.27 |
| Adafruit NAU7802 | 1.0.8 |
| Adafruit BusIO | 1.17.4 |
| ArduinoJson | 7.4.3 |
| Native PlatformIO platform | 1.2.1 |
| Configuration schema | 3 |

## Required Spoolman capabilities

- runtime info and health;
- list/filter/retrieve spool;
- set or measure remaining weight with read-after-write verification;
- locations;
- configurable extra-field discovery and merge-safe values;
- optional spool WebSocket updates.

## Required FilaBridge capabilities

- health/runtime version;
- configured printers and stable printer IDs;
- complete toolhead list/mappings;
- map and unmap through zero-based IDs;
- re-read mapping verification;
- printer state for remapping warnings;
- optional WebSocket status.

An unknown upstream version is reported as untested rather than disconnected.
Read capabilities remain available when their concrete probes succeed; mapping
writes remain guarded unless the response contract and an explicitly supported
runtime line both pass. Current-main development builds report `dev`, so that
compatibility lane is source-pinned to the commit recorded above and is not a
formal release-support claim.
